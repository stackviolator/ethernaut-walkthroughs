# Ethernaut Walkthroughs

This repository, `ethernaut-walkthroughs`, was created by Josh Merrill as a self-study project on smart contract security. The project was part of Josh's internship at KoreLogic Security in the summer of 2022.

The goal of this mini-project is to provide comprehensive walkthroughs for all levels of the Ethernaut smart contract CTF (https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), as well as to share slides from the final presentation, the source code for any exploits developed, and various notes that I found helpful.

We hope you find this resource valuable and enjoy exploring the world of Ethereum smart contract security!

## Walkthroughs

Detailed walkthroughs for each level of the Ethernaut CTF can be found in the `walkthroughs` directory. These guides will help you understand the challenges, potential security vulnerabilities, and the process of exploiting them.

## Final Presentation Slides

A set of presentation slides summarizing the key takeaways from this project can be found in the `presentation` directory. These slides provide an overview of the Ethernaut CTF, lessons learned, and essential smart contract security concepts.

## Exploit Source Code

The `exploits` directory contains the source code for various exploits developed during the project. These scripts demonstrate the practical application of smart contract security concepts and can serve as examples for your own work in the field.

Enjoy exploring the `ethernaut-walkthroughs` repository and best of luck with your own journey into Ethereum smart contract security!
