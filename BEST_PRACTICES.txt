This is a section of best practices I have accumulated that didn't fit neatly
into a level, or I learned about the best practice before/ after making a
writeup and didn't bother adding it :)

- Withdraw over send
	- There are various vulns associated with trusting a user to make send calls
		to transfer money (King and Reentrancy come to mind)
	- A better approach to getting the money to the end user is creating a
		system where a balance is assigned to the user and they are free to
		withdraw it whenever they please
		- Kinda like a bank now lol

	Example in code

	contract Something {

		mapping(address => uint) public balances;

		function someGame() public {
			// This is the meat of the contract's logic
			// Maybe this could be a game where if a player kills 20 zombie they get
			// a prize in eth
			if (player.numZombiesKilled > 20) {
				balances[player] += .001 eth;
			}
		}

		function withdraw() public {
			uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
			balances[player] = 0;
			msg.sender.transfer(amount);
		}
	}

	- If this example were to send the player eth in the someGame() function, a
		malicious actor could break the logic to mess with payments, contract
		state variables or other important assets
	- This separates the logic out decreasing risk for:
		- Software bugs affecting business operations
		- Known exploit techniques
		- More that my smooth brain at 12 am isnt coming up with :p
