NOTES
------------------

LEVEL 21: Shop
------------------

Vulnerability - Foreign contract calls
- The vulnerability in this challenge is very similar to the level Elevator
	(level 11) and therefore this writeup will be very short
- The challenge imports a contract, Buyer, that implements a function,
	price(), that will return an uint of the price of some item
- The goal is to get price() to return 0 or 100 on subsequent calls
	- This differs from Elevator as the function is marked "view"
	- View denotes that the function cannot make changes to the state and
		therefore can't employ the same create a variable on the attacking machine
		that we update during calls
- However, there is a variable that is updated in between the calls meaning we
	can use this as a sign for which value to return

Exploitation
- I will not be writing up the exploitation for this challenge as it is almost
	the exact same as Elevator
- See the code in "/contracts/21_shop.sol" for an example
