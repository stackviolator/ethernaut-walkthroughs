USE CHROME
	as of writing this (7/5/2022) there is an compatibility issue between
	metamask + firefox + ethernaut

	If you are an intern (L) you will need to download google-chrome instead of
	the built in chromium browsers

		sudo emerge -a google-chrome

Set up metamask and select the RINKEBY network (not Rostopen)

ABI - Communication layer between Solidity and js
Bytecode - low level machine code that is executed by the EVM
