LEVEL 4: TELEPHONE
------------------

Vulnerability - tx.origin
- tx.origin returns a value of the address of the account that sent the
	transaction
	- Can be used in phishing as well
- The contract validates the owner of the contract with:

	if (tx.origin != msg.sender)

	- meaning that the contract only checks to see what the address is of
		whoever called the changeOwner() function

Exploitation
- Source code for the exploit can be found at "contracts/4_telephone.sol"

- Create a malicious smart contract
	- Similar to the previous challenge, we will be using Remix IDE
	- File #1 - Telephone.sol
		- Create a new file, Telephone.sol and drop in the source of the contract
			given from Ethernaut. Luckily no adjustments need to be made this time
			around

	- File #2 - TelephoneAttacker.sol (exploit)
		- Create a new file in which we will create the exploit itself

		- Instantiate the instance from ethernaut
			- Within the contract, we need to create an instance of the victim

				Telephone public t = Telephone(ADDRESS OF INSTANCE);

			- Using this object, we are able to manipulate and call public functions

		- create a new function to change the owner
			- We are going to use this function to call the ORIGINAL changeOwner()
				function from the victim smart contract

				function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
            t.changeOwner(_owner);
      	}

			- This function calls changeOwner() of the instance of the Telephone object (t)
				- Since the original contract is the actualy entity that is calling
					the changeOwner() function, the transaction is tied to the address
					of the instance
				- When t.changeOwner() function is evaluting:

					 if (tx.origin != msg.sender)

					tx.origin is going to look for the address that called
					changeOwner(), resulting in the address of t
