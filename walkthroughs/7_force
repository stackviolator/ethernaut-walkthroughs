LEVEL 6: FORCE
------------------

Vulnerability - Forcing sent ether with selfdestruct()
- The goal of the level is to increase the balance of the contract to > 0 eth
- There is no code in the contract, no way to pay or send eth that we have
	seen

	contract Force {/*

											 MEOW ?
						 /\_/\   /
				____/ o o \
			/~____  =Ã¸= /
		 (______)__m_m)

		*/}


- selfdestruct()
	- selfdestruct deletes a contract from the blockchain and sends all
		remaining eth to an account specified as the parameter
	- goal: create a contract with a small amount of eth and blow it up with
		selfdestruct() with the address of the level instance as the parameter

Exploitation
- Full source code is found in "contracts/7_force.sol"

- Create a contract with some ETH
	- Creating a constructor

		constructor () public payable {
			}

		- The constructor has a payable keyword allowing us to pass eth into the
			contract on deployment.
		- This makes forwarding some eth to the contract much easier

- Call selfdestruct(address)
	- Creating a public function to call selfdestruct()

	  function attack(address payable _to) public payable {
			selfdestruct(_to)
		}

		- attack() takes in an address to send to selfdestruct, and simply calls
			the selfdestruct method

- Deploy the contract
	- Compile the contract and allocate some Wei to the "value", roughly 100000
		will work
	- Call the attack() function with the address of the instance of the level
