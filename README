This is an document made by Josh Merrill as a self study on smart contract
security. This was part of a project during his internship for KoreLogic
Security in summer 2022.

Within this mini-project I have walkthroughs for (hopefully) all the levels of
the smart contract CTF Ethernaut (https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), slides
for the final presentation, the source code for any exploits made and various
notes I deemed necessary. Enjoy :)
